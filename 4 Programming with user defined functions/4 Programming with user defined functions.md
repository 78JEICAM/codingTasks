 # Practical Task 1 - Holiday Cost Calculator

## Description:
In this task, you will create a Python script called `holiday.py` to calculate a user's total holiday cost, including the cost of the plane ticket, hotel stay, and car rental. The script will prompt the user to input details such as the city they will be flying to, the number of nights they will stay at a hotel, and the number of days for which they will hire a car. Based on these inputs, the script will calculate the total holiday cost and print out all the details in a readable format.

Learning to create functions and handle user input in Python is important for software engineers because:

- **Modularity:** Breaking down the holiday cost calculation into separate functions promotes code modularity, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
- **Code Reusability:** By defining reusable functions for calculating hotel cost, plane cost, car rental cost, and total holiday cost, developers can efficiently use these functions in other projects or scenarios.
- **Input Handling:** Prompting users for input and validating user-provided data are fundamental aspects of building interactive applications. Learning to handle user input enhances the usability and robustness of software systems.
- **Conditional Logic:** Using if/else statements within functions to retrieve prices based on chosen options demonstrates the use of conditional logic in Python, allowing developers to implement different behaviors based on specific conditions.
- **Function Composition:** The `holiday_cost` function serves as an example of function composition, where the output of one function serves as input to another function. Understanding function composition facilitates the construction of complex algorithms from simpler, reusable components.
