# Getting started with your bootcamp

## This topic covers four practical tasks. To navigate topic use the table of content included below:

### Practical task 1

##### You may at times find that there are certain commands that you use repeatedly. Instead of retyping these
##### commands into the command line repeatedly, you can create a script file that contains these sets of commands and that can be executed as needed. Often such files will be executed periodically, e.g. daily, weekly, monthly etc. In Windows, we can create batch   files and in Mac and Linux systems, we create shell scripts.

### Why scripts are important?

#### Learning script files is crucial for software engineers due to:

##### Automation: Streamlines repetitive tasks, reducing errors and saving time.
##### Efficiency: Allows quick task execution with minimal code.
##### Prototyping: Facilitates rapid idea testing before implementation.
##### Customization: Tailors processes to specific project needs.
##### Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensures seamless operation across different systems.
##### Integration: Interacts smoothly with other tools and services.
##### Version Control: Enables efficient tracking and collaboration.
##### Skill Development: Enhances problem-solving abilities and prepares for advanced tasks.


### In essence, mastering scripting enhances productivity and ensures timely delivery of high-quality solutions.

### Instructions for user:

#### The provided instructions outline the creation and execution of two script files: `file_cd.bat` and `ifExample.bat`. Let's break down each step:

##### 1. Create `file_cd.bat` script file:
#####   - This script file will create three new folders/directories and perform actions inside one of these folders.
#####   - The commands inside `file_cd.bat` will include:
#####     - Creation of three new folders.
#####     - Navigation into one of the created folders.
#####     - Creation of three new folders inside the selected folder.
#####     - Removal of two folders created earlier.

##### 2. **Create `ifExample.bat` script file**:
#####   - This script file will contain conditional statements to check for the existence of a specific folder named `new_folder`.
#####   - If `new_folder` exists, the script will create a new folder named `if_folder`.
#####   - Additionally, the script will include an if-else statement:
#####     - If `if_folder` exists, it will create a folder named `hyperionDev`.
#####     - If `if_folder` doesn't exist, it will create a folder named `new-projects`.

#### To summarize, `file_cd.bat` sets up a directory structure and makes changes within it, while `ifExample.bat` checks for the existence of certain folders and creates new folders based on the result of that check. These script files demonstrate basic file manipulation and conditional logic using batch scripting.

### Practical task 2 - hello_world.py

##### In this practical task user is getting familiar with VSC enviroment, writing pseudo code and is asked to input her/his name, and age, in return program create a string that is printed to the user saying "Hello world".

##### Learning input and print functions in Python, along with writing pseudocode, is important for software engineers because:

#### Understanding User Interaction: Input allows programs to receive data from users, while print enables displaying information to users. This interaction is fundamental for creating user-friendly software.

#### Testing and Debugging: Using input facilitates testing different scenarios and user inputs, aiding in the debugging process. Print statements help track program execution and verify the correctness of code.

#### Algorithm Design: Writing pseudocode helps in conceptualizing and planning algorithms before actual coding. It enables engineers to focus on the logic and structure of the solution without getting bogged down by syntax details.

#### Communication and Collaboration: Pseudocode serves as a common language for communication among team members, allowing them to discuss and refine ideas before implementation. It enhances collaboration and ensures everyone is on the same page.

#### Problem-Solving Skills: Practicing pseudocode and input/output handling in Python improves problem-solving skills by breaking down complex problems into manageable steps. It encourages engineers to think critically and logically about the problem at hand.

#### Translating Logic to Code: Pseudocode provides a bridge between problem-solving logic and actual code implementation. It helps engineers translate abstract ideas into concrete programming constructs, facilitating the coding process.

#### Efficiency and Optimization: Planning with pseudocode enables engineers to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize algorithms before writing actual code. This upfront analysis can lead to more efficient and scalable solutions.

#### In summary, mastering input and print functions in Python, along with proficient pseudocode writing, is essential for software engineers as it enhances their ability to design, communicate, and implement effective solutions to various problems.


#### This task is Python essentials, program doesn't need installation instructions becouse of it simplicity.

### Practical task 3 - details.py

#### In this task user is ask to imput few details about himself including: name age, street number and house number.

#### Why imput function is important?
#### The input function in Python is important because it allows programs to interact with users by accepting input from the keyboard. Here are some key reasons why the input function is essential:

#### User Interaction: The input function enables programs to prompt users for input, making applications interactive and dynamic.

#### Data Acquisition: It facilitates the acquisition of user-supplied data, which can be crucial for customizing program behavior or processing user-specific information.

#### Parameterization: Input allows users to provide parameters or arguments to customize program execution, enhancing flexibility and usability.

#### Configuration: Input can be used for configuring settings, preferences, or options within a program, making it adaptable to different use cases or user requirements.

#### Dynamic Behavior: By accepting input during runtime, programs can dynamically adjust their behavior based on user input, providing a personalized and responsive experience.

#### Testing and Debugging: During development, the input function can be used for testing different scenarios and debugging code by simulating user interactions.

#### Prototyping and Exploration: Input facilitates rapid prototyping and experimentation, allowing developers to quickly try out different ideas or scenarios without the need for extensive code modifications.

#### Educational Purposes: For educational purposes, the input function is valuable for teaching programming concepts and engaging students in hands-on exercises that involve user interaction.

#### Overall, the input function plays a crucial role in Python programming by enabling user interaction, data acquisition, program customization, and dynamic behavior, among other functionalities.
