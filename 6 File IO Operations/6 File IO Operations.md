# File IO Operations

  ## File IO operations is crucial for software engineers as it enables them to work with files, manage data persistence, share data between applications, configure software settings, implement logging and debugging mechanisms, process data, ensure data backup and recovery, facilitate inter-process communication, and implement security features. These skills are essential for developing robust, efficient, and secure software applications. There are two tasks:


## Practical Task 1: Date of Birth Data Parsing

### Description:
The task involves creating a Python script named `dob_task.py` to parse and display data from a text file (`DOB.txt`). The program reads the data from the text file and prints it out in two different sections: one for names and another for birthdates.

### Importance:
Learning to parse and process data from external sources is essential for software engineers. This task helps in understanding file handling, data extraction, and formatting. Additionally, it reinforces the importance of data organization and manipulation, which are core skills in software development.

### Installation:
No installation is required for running the Python script. However, ensure that the `DOB.txt` file is placed in the same directory as the `dob_task.py` script.

### Usage:
1. Clone or download the `dob_task.py` file and the `DOB.txt` file from the provided repository.
2. Place the `DOB.txt` file in the same directory as the `dob_task.py` script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where `dob_task.py` is located.
5. Run the script by executing the command: `python dob_task.py`.
6. The program will read the data from `DOB.txt`, parse it, and display the names and birthdates in two separate sections.

## Practical Task 2: Student Registration for Exam Venue

### Description:
The task involves creating a Python script named `student_register.py` to facilitate the registration of students for an exam venue. The program prompts the user to input the number of students to register, then iterates through a loop to collect the student ID numbers. Each ID number is written to a text file named `reg_form.txt` with a dotted line after each entry, simulating an attendance register.

### Importance:
Learning to handle file operations, such as writing data to a text file, is crucial for software engineers. This task helps reinforce the concept of file handling, looping, and user input validation. It also demonstrates the practical application of Python in managing administrative tasks, such as student registration.

### Installation:
No installation is required for running the Python script.

### Usage:
1. Clone or download the `student_register.py` file from the provided repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `student_register.py` is located.
4. Run the script by executing the command: `python student_register.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of students and their corresponding ID numbers.
6. The program will write each student ID number to the `reg_form.txt` file with a dotted line after each entry.
