    <h1>Practical Task 1 - Python String Manipulation</h1>
    
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This practical task involves creating a Python script called manipulation.py to perform various string manipulation tasks. The script asks the user to input a sentence, then calculates the length of the sentence, replaces every occurrence of the last letter with '@', prints the last 3 characters in reverse order, and creates a new five-letter word using a combination of the first three and last two characters of the input sentence.</p>
    <p>Learning this aspect of coding is important as it helps to develop skills in string manipulation, input/output handling, and basic algorithmic thinking.</p>
