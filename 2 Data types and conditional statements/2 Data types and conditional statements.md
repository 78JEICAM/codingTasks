# Practical Task 1 - Python String Manipulation

## Description:
This task involves creating a Python script called `manipulation.py` to perform various string manipulation tasks. The script prompts the user to input a sentence, calculates the length of the sentence, replaces every occurrence of the last letter with '@', prints the last 3 characters in reverse order, and creates a new five-letter word using a combination of the first three and last two characters of the input sentence.

Learning this aspect of coding is important as it helps to develop skills in string manipulation, input/output handling, and basic algorithmic thinking.

# Practical Task 2 - Python Number Operations

## Description:
For this task, you will create a Python script called `numbers.py`. This script prompts the user to input three different integers. It then performs various operations on these numbers, including calculating the sum of all numbers, subtracting the second number from the first, multiplying the third number by the first, and finding the sum of all three numbers divided by the third number.

Learning this aspect of coding is important as it helps to develop skills in basic arithmetic operations, user input handling, and understanding of mathematical expressions in programming.

# Practical Task 3 - Triathlon Awards Calculator

## Description:
For this task, you will create a Python script called `award.py`. This script is designed to determine the award a person competing in a triathlon will receive based on their completion time. The program reads in the times (in minutes) for swimming, cycling, and running events of a triathlon, calculates the total time taken to complete the triathlon, and then displays the award the participant will receive according to specified criteria.

Learning this aspect of coding is important as it helps to develop skills in input handling, mathematical calculations, conditional statements, and output formatting.

## Usage:
1. Clone or download the `award.py` file from this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `award.py` is saved.
4. Run the script by typing `python award.py` and press Enter.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the completion times for swimming, cycling, and running events.
6. View the award received by the participant based on the calculated total time printed in the terminal.

# Challenge 1 - Casting Practice

## Description:
In this challenge, you will create a Python script called `challenge_2.py`. The script prompts the user to input their favorite restaurant's name and their favorite number. It then stores the restaurant name in a string variable called `string_fav` and the favorite number in an integer variable called `int_fav`. The script prints out both the restaurant name and the favorite number using separate print statements. Additionally, it attempts to cast `string_fav` to an integer and includes a comment explaining why this may not work as expected.

Learning this aspect of coding is important as it helps to understand the limitations and behaviors of casting different data types in Python, which is essential for handling user input and data processing effectively.
