# Handling strings, lists, and dictionaries,

  ## Handling strings, lists, and dictionaries is vital for software engineers as these data structures form the backbone of many programming tasks. Mastery of these concepts enables engineers to efficiently process, manipulate, and organize data, leading to the development of robust and effective software solutions.

  ## Practical Task 1 - String Alternation

### Description:
In this task, you will create a Python script called `alternative.py`. The script reads in a string and alternates between making each character or each word uppercase and lowercase. It provides two options:

1. **Alternate Character Case**:
   - The program reads a string and converts every alternate character to uppercase and lowercase, respectively.
   - For example, the string "Hello World" would become "HeLlO WoRlD".

2. **Alternate Word Case**:
   - The program reads a string and alternates the case of each alternate word.
   - For example, the string "I am learning to code" would become "i AM learning TO code".

Understanding how to manipulate strings in Python is crucial for text processing tasks, data cleaning, and formatting operations. This task helps reinforce concepts such as string indexing, slicing, and manipulation, which are fundamental for working with textual data in Python.

## Practical Task 2 - Cafe Inventory Management

### Description:
In this task, you will create a Python script called `cafe.py` to manage inventory in a cafe. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Define a list called `menu` containing at least four items sold in the cafe.
2. Create a dictionary called `stock`, which contains the stock value for each item on the menu.
3. Create another dictionary called `price`, which contains the prices for each item on the menu.
4. Calculate the total stock worth in the cafe by iterating through the `menu`, `stock`, and `price` data structures.

Understanding how to work with lists, dictionaries, and loops in Python is essential for managing data effectively, especially in scenarios like inventory management. This task helps reinforce concepts such as data structures, iteration, and basic arithmetic operations, which are fundamental for building robust applications.
